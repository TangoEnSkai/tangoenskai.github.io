**Mercari Tech Conference 2018** at academyhills bldg., Roppongi, Minato, Tokyo

I joined [Mercari Tech Conference 2018](https://techconf.mercari.com). I was able to have nice talks with some of my friends working there as well as other Mercari engineers with their current works. Even though I was trying to join most of session in general, I spent more time on some sessions that talked about `Golang`, `Microservices`, and somehow Machine Learning. It was quite impressive that the company is going to change their system from **monolith** to **microservices** as well as changing their backend code in `php` to `golang`. I like one of the mottoes of the company, *GoBlod* and it made me remain this qoute:
