**Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) ON AGEING SOCIETY IN EAST AND NORTH-EAST ASIA (ENEA)**

**Jun Hahn**, _ACM SIGCHI Communication Ambassador_

According to United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN ESCAP), population ageing in East and North-East Asia (ENEA) is distinctly remarkable as the sub-region is home to a high ratio of elder people in the world [1]. In 2015, 32% of people in the world, older than 65 years old, are living in ENEA. In Asia, 56% of the older persons are from ENEA. By 2050, International Longevity Center Japan (ILC-Japan) has predicted one in every three persons will be older than 65 [2]. Therefore, a lot of HCI projects or related works have started to tackle issues with elderly people with HCI devices and systems especially in Japan and ENEA countries.

In November 2017, there was a symposium about a project called METESE by National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) from Japan and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT) [3]. METESE stands for MEaningful TEchnology for SEniors which aims to improve the quality of life for elderly people by utilising ICT-supportive services and robotic devices for the older users. In addition, there will be four academic conferences sponsored by ACM SIGCHI in Tokyo, Japan and Seoul, Korea in 2018. There will be papers [4] and workshops [5] on HCI systems for elderly users, hospital, visual impairment which are quite challenging, but important to design better lifestyle with HCI in the future.
