      <description>Mercari Tech Conference 2018 at academyhills bldg., Roppongi, Minato, Tokyo
I joined Mercari Tech Conference 2018.
First, I thank to Mercari to offer free student ticket for the conference and a chance to have a lunch with their engineers and other participants.
I was able to have nice talks with some of my friends working there as well as other Mercari engineers with their current works. Even though I was trying to join most of session in general, I spent more time on some sessions that talked about Golang, Microservices, and somehow Machine Learning.</description>
