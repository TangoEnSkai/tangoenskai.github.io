      <description>I started working as a contributor (translation Eng-Kor) for Google&amp;rsquo;s Go (golang) Programming Language, a Udemy course by Todd McLeod. Todd kindly accepted my suggestion to translate his contents in Korean and accepted my very first Pull Request.
The Github repository that I am working on is GoesToEleven/go-programming, espeically for English to Korean translation work.
I have researched some lectures/courses that seem good for a starting point to learn golang since I needed to pick a online course for a study group to learn golang (we decide to go through with a course with additonal materials) and Todd&amp;rsquo;s lectures on Udemy are highly recommended.</description>
